        For my personal home server, I decided to go with the Linux distro TrueNAS. This is a free and open-source distro,
        purpose-built for network attached storage systems, and is lightweight enough to be ran on the 18 year old hardware
        my family had lying around.
    </p>

    <p>The hardware I used for this build is the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad Q8300</li>
        <li>GPU: AMD Radeon R7 360</li>
        <li>RAM: 8GB DDR3</li>
        <li>Storage: 1x 3TB HDD, 1x 1TB HDD, 2x 800GB SSD, all running in RAID0 configuration</li>
        <li>Power Supply: 500W Generic PSU</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>This server has been able to meet my needs for running docker containers, media streaming, and file sharing.<br>
    The apps I run include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Plex Media Server</li>
        <li>Dockge for container management</li>
        <li>Metube for YouTube video downloading</li>
        <li>QBitTorrent for <em>LEGAL</em> file sharing</li>
        <li>Wireguard for secure VPN connections</li>
    </ul>
    

    <p>
        Setup was simple enough, with me creating a bootable USB drive using Ventoy and installing TrueNAS on the system. Once 
        the initial installation was complete, I was able to access the web interface and configure the storage pools, users, and 
        apps, with any troubleshooting being aided by the <a href="https://wiki.serversatho.me/">Servers@Home Wiki</a>.
    </p>

        This project helped me strengthen my understanding of Linux systems, networking, and storage management, as well as 
        familiarizing myself with headless server management. This also helped me familiarize myself with Docker and containers, 
        having to configure and manage multiple containers for different applications. This project also made me more comfortable 
        with troubleshooting hardware and software issues, and using Wiki documentation to solve problems.

        Some of the shortcomings with this server include the fact that the older hardware does limit some of what I can run,
        such as how I was unable to run a Minecraft server due to CPU and RAM limitations. Additionally, while I do have a graphics
        card installed, I got it recently, and have not found the time to passthrough the GPU for hardware transcoding in Plex. 
        This results in .265 HEC video playback on Plex being choppy unwatchable experience, forcing
        me to use .264 encoding, resulting in less efficient storage use. Lastly, the motherboard only has 4 SATA ports, meaning 
        that I am limited to 4 total drives without the use of expansion cards, and due to my storage needs, all of them are running 
        in the least secure RAID0 configuration, meaning that if one drive fails, all data is lost.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall though, I am very happy with how this project turned out, and how much utility I have been able to get out of it, 
        especially considering the only cost is the electricity to power it.
