      As a Christmas present for my brother in 2024, I decided to get him a complete Windows XP setup, all using period-accurate 
      hardware from the early 2000s. The acquisition of the hardware was actually rather easy, as one of my roommates mother had 
      acquired their old office PCs, and was looking to get rid of them anyway. I took them in, and was able to salavage and test 
      all of the parts, to frankenstein together a working system. For the peripherals, I was able to acquire the old CRT monitor, 
      along with a keyboard, mouse, and external speakers from my grandparents, who had stopped using their desktop PC years ago.

      This project helped me come to a greater understanding of older hardware and software, and their limitations, such as the 4GB 
      single-file size limit of FAT32. It also helped me troubleshoot and identify faulty hardware components, as many of the computers 
      did not work out of the box, as they had deteriorated while in storage, such as with leaky capacitors on the motherboard.

      Overall, this was a very enjoyable project to work on, and I am glad I was able to properly restore this hardware back to working 
      condition, as well as being able to gift it to my brother. In the end as well, I was able to keep a considerable amount of RW CDs, 
      as I needed them for the installation medium.
